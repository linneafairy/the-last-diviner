		<br><br>The city is a a hundred times more glorious than you could've ever conceived. The stone walls stand proud, holding up intricate architectures for watch towers and buildings. The white stone gives way to a set of long stairs, and atop it sits the royal palace. 
		<br><br>You climb up the stairs, nervousness growing with each step. They say the Shang kings have been friendlier than past generations, yet the new king, Di Xin, is known for his conquered around the borders of the dynasty.

		You were wrong about the King, it seems.
		<br><br> 
		Just when you were sure the King's urgency for your arrival was but an exaggeration, you had been called in haste to perform divination. 
		<br>You stand in front of the royal palace, your back against his tall form as your hands hovering under a prepared scapula, holding a torched hardwood brand that's slowly biting a dip in its underside. 
		<br><br>"Tell me," the King had said, his body draped over the carved throne, the infamous Daji to his side, her palm massaging into his shoulders. "Will the Shang thrive on in glory?" 
		And as lazy his tone was as his form, the steel in his eyes chills you.
		You feel his stare even now, unseeing his face. But no matter. To you, the oracle bone's ritual process has been written into your mind, from <a href="#" onclick="show('learned_divination','first_divination');change_color(this)">years of practice back in the Qiang state.</a>
		<br><br>Your hand moves almost mindlessly, aligning the scorched hollows from bottom to top as your eyes search for patterns, cracks, signs.
		<br><br>The preparations are soon finished in making. <a href="#" onclick="show('read_bone_1','first_divination');change_color(this)">You lean forward to take a look at the cracks.</a>

		In your memory, the life back home at Qiang was peaceful. While news of war raged, you can recall no turmoil from your childhood, nothing more than a rumor passing through the streets. 
		<br><br>You'd practiced and learned the art of oracle bone divination in those times, underneath the bright blue skies, often finding yourself tracing bone patterns into the dirt besides your legs as you herded the cattle. 
		<br><br>Now, those days seemed distant and faraway from the halls of <a href="#" onclick="show('first_divination','learned_divination');change_color(this)">the imperial palace.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="page" id="read_bone_1" style="display:none">
		As you run your eyes over the bone, you frown at how there are far more ominous cracks than auspicious ones.
		It is ritual process for a diviner to inscribe beside the cracks indicating good omens and leave the ominous cracks without comment, before the King proceeds with his interpretation.
		You know that if you leave the ominous cracks without inscriptions, the King will read this bone as a sign of the state's ill-boding fate instead of a glorious future. 
		You hesitate, and the King's chilling stare urges you to complete the ritual.

		<br>With a bow, a servant presents your bone to the King. As you watch in anticipation, a thunderous laughter escapes from him, the sound only pausing when the King takes a long swig of wine from the goblet in his hand. 
		Daji continues to comb his robes, her smile indulgent. 
		<br>They say the new Shang King is unlike his predecessors, violent in battle and fierce in conquest. 
		It seems that at this hour, you are fortuitous to not bear witness to his warlike nature. 
		<br><br>"I knew of it." The King declares, "indeed, your processions are true to the Qiang's esteem in divination." 
		A swell of pride expands at your chest at the unexpected praise. Such a feat it is, garnering the favor of the King at your first ritual! 
		<br><br>"Leave us now," The King says with a wave of his hand. You bow, and exit the hall. 
		Content at the King's response, you hum and stroll from the palace. 
		You are about to head towards the market, when a voice behind you speaks. 
		<br><br>"Ah, you must be the diviner my father called forth from Qiang." 
		You turn in complete shock and hastily drop into a bow in front of a young man, who must be the prince. 
		"Your Highness!" You scramble for words. "Forgive me, I'm simply surprised to see you about. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
		<br><br>"Well, I witnessed your skill at divination just a few moments ago, and I wished to know you, of course," says the prince. 
		"I have always been curious of the process. Won't you join me for a walk in the marketplace?"
		You are astounded. The prince himself wishes to speak with you as a companion to the city?

		"Well, worry not, for I have time today for a short trip, if not anything," says the prince, before heading towards the gates. "Let us go, then." You follow suit, curious of the city as much as of the prince. 
		<br><br><i>Why is he taking such an interest in you, a modest diviner?</i>
		<br><br>The pair of you trek across streets, where busy tradesmen call to passerby and haggle prices. Your eyes wander at all the various dishes and jewlery. Far off in the distance, a column of black smoke rises, just as it has always been every morning out your window since your arrival.	
		<br><br>Sure enough, the prince asks you questions about your divinations, and how you indicate the good fortune versus the bad. You answer his queries one by one, yet you find yourself thinking of questions of your own as well.

		The prince's brow tilts. "Well, in honesty I wondered if I could learn," he says. "Of course, it's impossible for me with my responsibilities as heir, but I suppose I wanted to advise my father, in a way."
		<br><br>Your curiosity grows, and you ask him what he means. 
		<br><br>The prince smirks. "Father is the best King our kingdom has ever seen, of cours," he says, with an air of certainty that compells you to agree. "He was a war hero before he was king, and he was a fierce general bringing upon glory. He is the proud sun of Shang and our court his pride." 
		<br><br>"Each and every one in court respects him, and I the most. I wish I could contribute, to live up to his name, you see. But he's yet to let me advise in court," the prince says, though you notice how his tone turns bitter by the end. 
		<br><br>It is plain to you that the prince dislikes a certain person at the King's side, that Daji figure. But you'd witnessed his idolation of his father. If not prideful, the prince is a man of candor, and his respect rings true.
		<br><br>The pair of you walk forward, the racket of merchants covering your muddled thoughts. You are reminded of <a href="#" onclick="show('visit_lutai','prince_praise_king');change_color(this)">the smoke</a> once more, now closer to you than before.

		<br><br>You follow suit as he walks forth, trekking towards the billowing smoke, and find youself standing at the foot of a grand terrance, levels upon levels, surrounded by few wooden beams of support as workers mill by, carrying heavy stones.
		<br><br>"Father built this terrance to hold all treasures from battle," the prince explains, as your eyes wander from the white marble walls to the warm glow of engraved agate. "This place is for celebration and leisure&mdash;to substitute the pains of war, I suppose."
		<br><br>This must be the reason the King was careless of your lack of treasures, you thought. Perhaps it is because he only values the items he earned with blood.

You feel the weight of that truth upon you now, as the King's attention drifts from the bone to you, face clouded in cold fury.

		The advisor chuckles, yet you hear the hidden silver of remorse in his voice. "Ah yes, I do understand how he must seem. But you must see that he's been made so by decades of war. Let me give you another chance for both our city and King." He points towards the city, an invitation. "Walk with me?" 
		<br><br>You follow suit, curious of the city as much as the advisor's thoughts. <i>Why is this kind man so keen to defend the King, his eyes shining with loyalty?</i>
		<br><br>The pair of you trek across streets, where busy tradesmen call to passerby and haggle prices. Your eyes wander at all the various dishes and jewelry. Far off in the distance, a column of black smoke rises, just as it has always been every morning out your window since your arrival.
		<br><br>You turn to your newfound friend, whose name you've let to learn. You ask, and he laughs once more. "Zhang Ruyi, but call me Ruyi, if you wish. No use for formalities between friends." You smile in response.
		<br><br><a href="#" onclick="show('visit_lutai_advisor','make_joke');change_color(this)">"I'm curious of that smoke. Can we go to where it is rising?"</a>

		The advisor&mdash;or rather, Ruyi&mdash;sighed. "I was one of the many high-ranking soldiers in his troops back when we were at war with the unrest states," he says as he walks amongst the shops slowly, allowing you to leisurely pick and clamor at the various trinkets. 
		<br><br>Yet your curiosity to hear more of his past rather than roam is keen. Ruyi continues, his eyes now faraway and immersed in memories. "Back then, we knew him as General Di Xin. He was...fierce in battle, and an amazing strategist. He was loyal to us and we were to him, comrades in arms as you may say. All those years have forged him now, with harshness and decisiveness." 
		<br><br>"I understand you must be confused by my loyalty, but I know the man who sits upon that throne, regardless of who's by his side." Ruyi says, though you noticed how his tone turns bitter by the end. 
		<br><br>It is plain to you that Ruyi dislikes a certain person by the King's side, that Daji figure. But his loyalty is true and sound&mdash;Ruyi is a soldier, a man of fidelity.
		<br><br>The pair of you walk forward, the racket of merchants covering your muddled thoughts. You are reminded of <a href="#" onclick="show('visit_lutai_advisor','advisor_defends_king');change_color(this)">the smoke</a> once more, now closer to you than before.
	</div>
	<div class="page" id="visit_lutai_advisor" style="display:none">
		"That smoke? It's from the workers building Lutai, you see," says Ruyi. "Come, I'll show you."
		<br><br>You follow suit as he walks forth, trekking towards the billowing smoke, and find youself standing at the foot of a grand terrance, levels upon levels, surrounded by few wooden beams of support as workers mill by, carrying heavy stones.
		<br><br>"Our King is building this grand terrance to hold all treasures we've earned with years at war," Ruyi explains, as your eyes wander from the white marble walls to the warm glow of engraved agate. "This place is built for celebration and leisure enjoyments&mdash;a true gift for all our suffering for this kingdom."
		<br><br>This must be the reason the King was careless of your lack of treasures, you thought. All the pleasures and fine gifts he sought may be too much, even for Lutai.

		You start towards the gates, yet stop once more at Ruyi's hand. 
		<br><br>"I'm afraid we cannot go inside, my friend," he says, with a sweeping look towards the tall terrance. "The work is almost finished, and the King explicitly ordered to not have anyone enter save for the workers. Let us head once more to the market&mdash;I must show you the exquisite work of the bronze craftsmen."
		<br><br>As Ruyi turns, you take yet another moment to look. Not at the terrance this time, but rather the workers toiling by. You watch as their backs bend, hauling heavy masses onto their sweat-stained shoulders, faces crying silently in weariness.

		<br><br>"Ask this of the spirits," says the King, "is it auspicious to conquer our neighboring state Gui?"
		<br><br>You tamp down a sharp inhale at this request. Compared to the King, you are a mere stranger to violence and warfare, raised in a life of scholarship in the mellow Qiang.
		<br><br>Be as it may, you cannot disobey such an order. You close your eyes as the cracks begin to appear. Removing the fire, you <a href="#" onclick="show('read_bone_2','ch2_start');change_color(this)">open your eyes.</a>

		<br><br>The court disperses, and you take your leave as well. On your way out, you see one of the advisors--Ruyi, you recall--with pale face and shaking fingers. But you are swiftly whisked away with the rest of the court.

		<br><br>Advisor Ruyi has hanged himself. His form is boneless, face white as a sheet. Try as you may, you cannot find a sign of breathing, of life. 
		<br><br>You force yourself to look away in shock. You try to focus on the splattered ink, patternless as it was. 
		<br><br>But wait. The black liquid lies in long strokes, as if writing on a scroll. You shift, chasing the strokes like you do with cracks on the bone. <a href="#" onclick="show('ruyi_to_daji','ruyi_suicide');change_color(this)">And then, you see it.</a>

		<br><br>Spirits above. You feel dread pooling into your stomach, and suddenly you can no longer bear being in that room, not when Ruyi's soul lies so close to you, you who inscribed the bone permitting the King's act of war.

		<br><br>"I hope that they are," he had said. "There are far worse fates."

		As you creep closer to the bed chambers, you hear it: two voices, one indignant and one irritated. 
		"It's nonsense! Spirits do not disobey the will of the King," the first voice declares, and you finally recognize the familiar tone: it is the prince, who'd sat by the King now and then in Court. 
		<br><br>The second voice--which must belong to the King, you reason--lets out a huff. "And what will you have me do, hmm? Denounce the spirits and ancestors in front of all advisors?"
		<br><br>Silence. Then, the prince speaks once more: "Apologies, father. I only ever wished to grant glory to your name."
		<br><br>"Yes, yes," says the King, "and your worries are no longer welcomed. You are dismissed." A few moments, and you see the prince step out, his face still twisted in unsatisfied fury. 
		<br><br>And then, another voice: "Has he gone?"
		<br><br>Not to be deterred now, you <a href="#" onclick="show('daji_king_talk','prince_king_talk');change_color(this)">lean forward once more to listen in.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="page" id="daji_king_talk" style="display:none">
		"Yes, my favored," says the King, and it dawns on you just then that you are not the only one hiding.
		<br><br>"At long last!" Daji's voice floats from within the room. "I thought he meant to stay the night." 
		<br><br>"I have no interest in entertaining that spoilt child," said the King with a scoff. "In his presence, I cannot speak freely of my...plans, that is."
		<br><br>A rustle, and Daji's voice is now a murmur. "And what did you have in mind, my King?"
		<br><br>The King laughs brusquely. "Nights with you are a given, dear," he says. "And you know what I mean. The boy would spread my plan of secret invasion like wildfire before my men are ready to march."
		<br><br>You have to stifle a gasp before it alerts the King and his consort. <i>An invasion into Gui, still? Despite the bone's message?</i>
		<br><br>Lost in thought, you almost fail to notice Daji stepping from the doors, a furtive look upon her face. She glances around, but does not see you. As she swiftly walks away, you can't help but notice that she is walking in the direction of Lutai in the city. 
		<br><br><a href="#" onclick="show('daji_prisoner','daji_king_talk');change_color(this)">What is she up to?</a>
	</div>
	<div class="page" id="daji_prisoner" style="display:none">
		Daji takes no notice of you trailing behind her. As workers and guards surrounding Lutai turn their backs, she slips through a back door you would not have seen otherwise. You follow suit, curiosity brewing.
		<br><br><IMG SRC="images/daji.png" width="100"/>
		<br><br>Instead of entering Lutai itself, Daji approaches an ordinary straw shed nearby. You plaster your ear to a small crack upon the wall, and listen.
		<br><br>"--I've no care for you as much as that snake, Dixin." A voice you do not recognize snarls, followed by a rattle of bronze scraping against each other. Your eyes widen. A man, bound in chains.
		<br><br>An airy chuckle stops him short. "You made that quite clear when you had a knife pointing to my heart, peasant," says Daji, her tone mocking. "For whom were you truly aiming? Me, or the King?" 
		<br><br>"Does it matter?" More sounds of metal, clinking together as the man likely struggles against his chains amidst shouts. "You and that beast of a man are the poisons of this world! Needless war, higher taxation--people starve as you party amongst pools of liquor. Any blood on my knife would've been a blessing from spirits."
		<br><br>"You can curse and spit all you want," Daji's voice is soft, sending pinpricks down your back. "But your 'needless wars' are the only thing holding this kingdom's failing states together. Why resist then, when the Shang thrives as one under my King?"
		<br><br>The chains thrash even harder as the man cries out in rage. "You dare! You shameless consort--"
		<br><br>"You know of the punishments we have for assassinations like yours," says Daji. "If I were you, I wouldn't waste my breath while I still had it."
		<br><br>With a swing and a click of the door, all is silent. 
		<br><br>"Come inside." The voice says suddenly. You jump at the words, and give a sweeping look around the shed. You are the only one there, now, apart from the man calling for you. 
		<br><br>The voice sighs, "I know you're there, fool."
		<br><br><a href="#" onclick="show('player_prisoner','daji_prisoner');change_color(this)">With a shaky breath, you open the door and slip in.</a>

		<br><br>You winced at his words. "Not a guard," you say. "I'm but a diviner from the Qiang state by royal command."
		<br><br>At that, the man's eyes have a strange glint to them. "From Qiang, eh? And how's working for the man that killed so many of your own?"
		<br><br>You still. There are too many thoughts, too many questions in your mind.

		The man pauses, and lifts his head to fully look at you. You feel his eyes take in your form, your stance, your face. He must see something there, as he begins to speak.
		<br><br>"My name is Wenxue, but who I am is unimportant," he says. "It's where I'm from that matters." His eyes search yours once more, and his speech lowers to a faint whisper. "I'm from the Zhou state."
		<br><br>The Zhou. You know of them, of couse, as one of the many states under Shang's ruling.
		<br><br>"You must know by now that the King has long lost himself to decadence and corruption," the man, Wenxue, says. "There may be no way out for me, but perhaps you can carry on my mission."
		<br><br>"You want me to kill the King?!" you whisper-shout. 
		<br><br>Wenxue waves his hand in dismissal. "No, no...I was meant to be a, ah, 'messenger' for the Zhou. The Zhou King has kept his eyes sharpened all these years, you see. He sees the people suffering and the cruelty of the Shang King. And he has been preparing."
		<br><br>"Preparing," you say. A slight tremble has overtaken your fingers, but you feel strangely devoid of emotion.
		<br><br>Wenxue gazes at you meaningfully. "He is ready, now. If you can take my place, and transcribe what you see, what you hear, what you know of the court...Soon enough, the people under Shang will no longer have to suffer."
		<br><br><i>Because there will be no Shang left for them to fear.</i>
		<br><br>Wenxue tells you of correspondence, of how he had relayed critical messages and information to the Zhou without becoming exposed to the King's forces. You listen in a daze, committing his words to memory and yet not quite comprehending your situation.
		<br><br>You cannot quite recall when you left the shed, or trekked back to the palace. As you sit down on the bed that night, you can only remember the look on Wenxue's face, pained yet hopeful.
		<a href="#" onclick="show('ch3_start','prisoner_rebel');change_color(this)">You do not sleep. Instead, you watch as the sky bleeds from dark to light, the sun rising in the east.</a>

		<br><br>You swallow. "And what of the Qiang?"
		<br><br>He regards you, disappointed and distraught all the same. "You truly do not know."
		<br><br>"What do I not know?"
		<br><br>Wenxue squares his shoulders, making the chains around his wrists clash once more in a cacophony of screeches. "They keep your soldiers for only one of two purposes," he says quietly, head bowed in an mockery of an apology. "Either they labor to build Lutai until they can no longer walk, or..."
		<br><br>"Or?" You feel like an impatient child, even as the horror of his words begins to catch up to you.
		<br><br>"...Or they are sacrificed and slaughtered in front of crowds to the heavens," says Wenxue. "A display of power. A permanent reminder that the Shang King is in control."
		<br><br>The air is still. You stand, frozen. Outside, you hear the workers at Lutai, the thud of their footsteps and erratic heartbeats. You inhale, and let go of a trembling breath.

		<br><br>You keep your thoughts to yourself, that the King means to conquer to strengthen the Shang and unify the states. That perhaps conquests were not loved but needed. You've learned quite a lot from being in court each day, it seems.
		<br><br>Something Wenxue said had caught your attention.  Not <i>supposed</i> to, he had said.

		<br><br>You follow the soldiers outside, and see for the first time the royal palace in disarray. The Shang royal guards had evidently been drastically outnumbered; it seems that many soldiers had abandoned their posts, unable to tolerate the Shang King's brutality any longer. 
		<br><br>As you trek further away from the palace, you suddenly see a light in the distance, coming from the direction of Lutai. Only later do you hear that the Shang King had tied himself to that unfinished palace's pinnacle, and set himself alight.

He lays a hand upon your shoulder, and his lips twist into a satisfied smirk. The King's trust in you grows. You bow at his towering figure, and he leaves you there, in sole contemplation once more.
