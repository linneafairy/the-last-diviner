		You follow the man into the walls of Zhaoge, hefting your bags onto your shoulders.
		<br><br>The city is a a hundred times more glorious than you could've ever conceived. The stone walls stand proud, holding up intricate architectures for watch towers and buildings. The white stone gives way to a set of long stairs, and atop it sits the royal palace. 
		<br><br>You climb up the stairs, nervousness growing with each step. They say the Shang kings have been friendlier than past generations, yet the new king, Di Xin, is known for his conquered around the borders of the dynasty.

		Just when you were sure the King's urgency for your arrival was but an exaggeration, you had been called in haste to perform divination. 
		<br>You stand in front of the royal palace, your back against his tall form as your hands hovering under a prepared scapula, holding a torched hardwood brand that's slowly biting a dip in its underside. 
		<br><br>"Tell me," the King had said, his body draped over the carved throne, the infamous Daji to his side, her palm massaging into his shoulders. "Will the Shang thrive on in glory?" 
		And as lazy his tone was as his form, the steel in his eyes chills you.
		You feel his stare even now, unseeing his face. But no matter. To you, the oracle bone's ritual process has been written into your mind, from <a href="#" onclick="return show('learned_divination','first_divination');">years of practice back in the Qiang state.</a>
		<br><br>Your hand moves almost mindlessly, aligning the scorched hollows from bottom to top as your eyes search for patterns, cracks, signs.

		<br><br>You'd practiced and learned the art of oracle bone divination in those times, underneath the bright blue skies, often finding yourself tracing bone patterns into the dirt besides your legs as you herded the cattle. 
		<br><br>Now, those days seemed distant and faraway from the halls of <a href="#" onclick="return show('first_divination','learned_divination');">the imperial palace.</a>

	<div class="page" id="read_bone_1" style="display:none">
		As you run your eyes over the bone, you frown at how there are far more ominous cracks than auspicious ones.
		It is ritual process for a diviner to inscribe beside the cracks indicating good omens and leave the ominous cracks without comment, before the King proceeds with his interpretation.
		You know that if you leave the ominous cracks without inscriptions, the King will read this bone as a sign of the state's ill-boding fate instead of a glorious future. 
		You hesitate, and the King's chilling stare urges you to complete the ritual.

		Daji continues to comb his robes, her smile indulgent. 
		<br>They say the new Shang King is unlike his predecessors, violent in battle and fierce in conquest. 
		It seems that at this hour, you are fortuitous to not bear witness to his warlike nature. 
		<br><br>"I knew of it." The King declares, "indeed, your processions are true to the Qiang's esteem in divination." 
		A swell of pride expands at your chest at the unexpected praise. Such a feat it is, garnering the favor of the King at your first ritual! 
		<br><br>"Leave us now," The King says with a wave of his hand. You bow, and exit the hall. 
		Content at the King's response, you hum and stroll from the palace. 
		You are about to head towards the market, when a voice behind you speaks. 
		<br><br>"Ah, you must be the diviner my father called forth from Qiang." 
		You turn in complete shock and hastily drop into a bow in front of a young man, who must be the prince. 
		"Your Highness!" You scramble for words. "Forgive me, I'm simply surprised to see you about. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
		<br><br>"Well, I witnessed your skill at divination just a few moments ago, and I wished to know you, of course," says the prince. 
		"I have always been curious of the process. Won't you join me for a walk in the marketplace?"

		<br><br>The pair of you trek across streets, where busy tradesmen call to passerby and haggle prices. Your eyes wander at all the various dishes and jewlery. Far off in the distance, a column of black smoke rises, just as it has always been every morning out your window since your arrival.	
		<br><br>Sure enough, the prince asks you questions about your divinations, and how you indicate the good fortune versus the bad. You answer his queries one by one, yet you find yourself thinking of questions of your own as well.

		The prince's brow tilts. "Well, in honesty I wondered if I could learn," he says. "Of course, it's impossible for me with my responsibilities as heir, but I suppose I wanted to advise my father, in a way."
		<br><br>Your curiosity grows, and you ask him what he means. 
		<br><br>The prince smirks. "Father is the best King our kingdom has ever seen, of cours," he says, with an air of certainty that compells you to agree. "He was a war hero before he was king, and he was a fierce general bringing upon glory. He is the proud sun of Shang and our court his pride." 
		<br><br>"Each and every one in court respects him, and I the most. I wish I could contribute, to live up to his name, you see. But he's yet to let me advise in court," the prince says, though you notice how his tone turns bitter by the end. 
		<br><br>It is plain to you that the prince dislikes a certain person at the King's side, that Daji figure. But you'd witnessed his idolation of his father. If not prideful, the prince is a man of candor, and his respect rings true.
		<br><br>The pair of you walk forward, the racket of merchants covering your muddled thoughts. You are reminded of <a href="#" onclick="return show('visit_lutai','prince_praise_king');">the smoke</a> once more, now closer to you than before.

		<br><br>You follow suit as he walks forth, trekking towards the billowing smoke, and find youself standing at the foot of a grand terrance, levels upon levels, surrounded by few wooden beams of support as workers mill by, carrying heavy stones.
		<br><br>"Father built this terrance to hold all treasures from battle," the prince explains, as your eyes wander from the white marble walls to the warm glow of engraved agate. "This place is for celebration and leisure--to substitute the pains of war, I suppose."
		<br><br>This must be the reason the King was careless of your lack of treasures, you thought. Perhaps it is because he only values the items he earned with blood.

You feel the weight of that truth upon you now, as the King's attention drifts from the bone to you, face clouded in cold fury.

		<br><br>You turn to your newfound friend, whose name you've let to learn. You ask, and he laughs once more. "Zhang Ruyi, but call me Ruyi, if you wish. No use for formalities between friends." You smile in response.
		<br><br><a href="#" onclick="return show('visit_lutai_advisor','make_joke');">"I'm curious of that smoke. Can we go to where it is rising?"</a>
		<br><br><a href="#" onclick="return show('advisor_defends_king','make_joke');">"Tell me more of the King. Why are you loyal as so?"</a>

		The advisor--or rather, Ruyi--sighed. "I was one of the many high-ranking soldiers in his troops back when we were at war with the unrest states," he says as he walks amongst the shops slowly, allowing you to leisurely pick and clamor at the various trinkets. 
		<br><br>Yet your curiosity to hear more of his past rather than roam is keen. Ruyi continues, his eyes now faraway and immersed in memories. "Back then, we knew him as General Di Xin. He was...fierce in battle, and an amazing strategist. He was loyal to us and we were to him, comrades in arms as you may say. All those years have forged him now, with harshness and decisiveness." 
		<br><br>"I understand you must be confused by my loyalty, but I know the man who sits upon that throne, regardless of who's by his side." Ruyi says, though you noticed how his tone turns bitter by the end. 
		<br><br>It is plain to you that Ruyi dislikes a certain person by the King's side, that Daji figure. But his loyalty is true and sound--Ruyi is a soldier, a man of fidelity.
		<br><br>The pair of you walk forward, the racket of merchants covering your muddled thoughts. You are reminded of <a href="#" onclick="return show('visit_lutai_advisor','advisor_defends_king');">the smoke</a> once more, now closer to you than before.

	<div class="page" id="visit_lutai_advisor" style="display:none">
		"That smoke? It's from the workers building Lutai, you see," says Ruyi. "Come, I'll show you."
		<br><br>You follow suit as he walks forth, trekking towards the billowing smoke, and find youself standing at the foot of a grand terrance, levels upon levels, surrounded by few wooden beams of support as workers mill by, carrying heavy stones.
		<br><br>"Our King is building this grand terrance to hold all treasures we've earned with years at war," Ruyi explains, as your eyes wander from the white marble walls to the warm glow of engraved agate. "This place is built for celebration and leisure enjoyments--a true gift for all our suffering for this kingdom."
		<br><br>This must be the reason the King was careless of your lack of treasures, you thought. All the pleasures and fine gifts he sought may be too much, even for Lutai.

		You start towards the gates, yet stop once more at Ruyi's hand. 
		<br><br>"I'm afraid we cannot go inside, my friend," he says, with a sweeping look towards the tall terrance. "The work is almost finished, and the King explicitly ordered to not have anyone enter save for the workers. Let us head once more to the market--I must show you the exquisite work of the bronze craftsmen."
		<br><br>As Ruyi turns, you take yet another moment to look. Not at the terrance this time, but rather the workers toiling by. You watch as their backs bend, hauling heavy masses onto their sweat-stained shoulders, faces crying silently in weariness.
